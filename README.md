Today's Progress:
More morning coding in. Still working on Ex 8.8 in  the #Python book, PCC Vol. 1 by @ehmatthes
which involves returning a dictionary via user input to show artist & album names. 

Thoughts:
Fixed a problem with pushing commits from my local repo to github. Followed an excelleent video on how to do this after @osusuwayne helped me set it up for my PCC exercises. After two hours of reading Google results, I found that the video instructions resulted in me creating my local repo within the admin folder on my MacBook Pro. That repo folder has the original .git file that allowed me to create and oush my README.txt file successfully to github. I created a folder with the same name in my Python folder, then added my programs to it, BUT, everytime I try to add the programs to the staging area, it said my branch was up to date and there was nothing to commit. The reason that was coccuring was because the process was referencing the wrong .git file. The fix involved me moving the repo folder (with the correct .git file) to replace the repo folder I created manually. Once that was done, I moved my programs into that folder and was able to successfully commit all seven of them to Github. Happy about that!

Today's Progress:
Got my feet wet with my first intro to data science using pandas this morning. Wrote an eight line block of code showing how many apples and oranges each were purchased by customers at a fruit stand! I'm a datascience wizard now.

Thoughts:
Looking forward to really understanding and using the tools available to analyze data science with Python.
